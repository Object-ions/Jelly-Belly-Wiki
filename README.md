## [Project Description](#project-description)

The Jelly Belly Wiki Project is an integrated solution comprising a data collection subsystem, a backend API, and a frontend client. This project showcases a comprehensive approach to full-stack web development, with a focus on the Jelly Belly candy brand. The data collection subsystem employs Python scripts for web scraping, the backend API is developed with C# .NET EF Core and MySQL, and the frontend client is built using React.

## [Project Overview](#project-overview)

This project is structured into three main components, each residing in its own submodule within this repository:

1. **Jelly Belly Wiki API Data Collection**: [Repository](https://github.com/Object-ions/Jelly-Belly-Wiki-API-Data-Collection): this repository dedicated to scripts and supporting files for data collection, primarily using Python for web scraping from the official Jelly Belly website.

2. **Jelly-Belly-Wiki-API**: [Repository](https://github.com/Object-ions/Jelly-Belly-Wiki-API): This repository contains the API implementation and the seeded data from the scraping process. The API is built using C# and EF Core .Net with MySql migrations.

3. **Jelly-Belly-Wiki-Client**: [Repository](https://github.com/Object-ions/Jelly_Belly_Wiki_Client): The client-side component focusing on user interface and interaction. It includes all frontend development, offering a visually appealing and demonstrates the API's application and functional user experience.

**Note**
Each submodule is equipped with its own README file, containing detailed instructions, documentation, and specific notes relevant to that part of the project.

## [Important Note for Running the Application](#important-note-for-running-the-application)

In order to fully experience the Jelly Belly Wiki application, it is essential to follow these steps:

1. **API and Database Setup**:

   - First, download and install the API from the `/API` submodule. This step is crucial as the API serves as the backend for the application and interacts with the database.
   - Ensure that the database is properly set up and connected as per the instructions in the API repository.

2. **Client UI Installation**:

   - After setting up the API and database, proceed to download and install the client UI from the `/Client` submodule. The client UI is the frontend of the application and requires the API to be operational for the full functionality.

3. **Data Collection Scripts**:
   - The data collection scripts located in the `/Data-Collection` submodule have already been executed to scrape and seed the data into the API's database. Therefore, it is not necessary to run these scripts for the application to work.
   - These scripts are included in the repository to provide insight into the data collection and preparation process, which is a fundamental aspect of this project.

By following these instructions, you can ensure a smooth setup and enjoy the complete functionality of the Jelly Belly Wiki application.
